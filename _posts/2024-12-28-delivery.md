```

two ports 80,8065 seems like two websites are hosted here 

I found  a new subdomain ![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525132613.png)

seems like OsTicket

let's try to open a ticket 
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525132720.png)


![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525132827.png)

let's view our ticket  `5823990@delivery.htb`

![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525132913.png)![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525132929.png)

at this point a tried an SSRF , https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49441
but didn't work , let's check the other website 

we can create account  

![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525133112.png)

we need to verify our mail 
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525133202.png)

but the htb boxes are not connected to the internet so how tf we will get an email 


going back the OSTICKET , maybe we can use this to verify our mail since we have access to the thread of this ticket
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525132827.png)



we got this 
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525133433.png)


once we logged in , we found creds
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525133531.png)


now we can ssh into the box , and use Pwnkit to get root

<!-- that's what I did , but ippsec did another thing 

![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Delivery/Pasted image 20240525152121.png)

he use hashcat rule (best64), to create a wordlist of the ==PleasrSubscibe!==

and use tool like ==sucrack== https://github.com/hemp3l/sucrack

or  if we check the config file of the mattermost in the /opt , we could find credential of mysql
then get the root hash and crack it offline with hashcat and the wordlist we create before  -->
