# About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m d0s3nt/c01174z, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep interest in exploring and mastering the ever-evolving world of technology. My journey in cybersecurity revolves around the thrill of solving complex challenges, uncovering vulnerabilities, and staying ahead in the cybersecurity landscape.

## What I Do

- **Web and Box Pentesting**: I love diving into web applications and CTF-style challenges, identifying weaknesses, and learning from every engagement. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how small details can make or break security.

- **Red Teaming**: I thrive in offensive security, simulating adversary tactics to test and improve security measures. Crafting creative attacks and bypassing defenses is both an art and a science that Iâ€™m deeply passionate about.

- **Blue Team Exploration**: While my heart lies in the offensive side, I also enjoy delving into the blue team perspectiveâ€”learning how defenders operate, setting up resilient systems, and understanding the strategies needed to thwart attacks.

- **Low-Level Coding (C/C++)**: I enjoy working with low-level programming languages like C and C++, which allow me to understand systems at a deeper level and create efficient, optimized solutions. This skill also enhances my ability to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities effectively.

## Why Cybersecurity?

The field of cybersecurity excites me because itâ€™s dynamic, rewarding, and constantly challenges me to grow. Itâ€™s not just about finding vulnerabilities but about understanding systems, people, and processes to make the digital world safer.

## Beyond Cybersecurity

When Iâ€™m not testing systems or learning new techniques, I enjoy:
- Gaming â€“ A perfect way to unwind and feed my competitive spirit.
- Exploring new ideas â€“ Whether itâ€™s technology, life hacks, or creative projects, Iâ€™m always curious.
